# Daedalus Loader Mods
Keep in mind that most of these mods only work with my fork of the Daedalus loader.
* Teleporter : Adds a teleporter that can be crafted from the fabricator.  Right click saves your current location, and left click teleports you to that location.
* Auto Move : The equal key now acts as a toggle for the w key.
* Mini Map : Adds a mini map to the bottom left corner.
