# Daedalus Loader Mods
Keep in mind that most of these mods only work with my fork of the Daedalus loader.
* KeepLoadout : Allows any item to be brought into orbit though the dropship on either propsect or outpost.
* Teleporter : Adds a teleporter that can be crafted from the fabricator.  Right click saves your current location, and left click teleports you to that location.
